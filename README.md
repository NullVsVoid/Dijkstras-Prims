## Introduction

Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm are widely used algorithms in computer science for solving
problems related to graphs. This repository aims to provide a clear understanding of these
algorithms by providing their implementations, pseudocode, and simple examples.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path between a source node and
all other nodes in a weighted graph. It can be applied in various scenarios, such as finding the
shortest route between two locations on a map, network routing protocols, and more.

- `Dijkstra.cpp`: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++.
- `DijkstraExample.cpp`: Example use case of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path
  between two cities on a map.
- `DijkstraPseudo.txt`: Pseudocode for Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted,
connected, and undirected graph. It can be applied in scenarios such as building a cost-effective
cable network to connect multiple houses or cities.

- `Prim.cpp`: Implementation of Prim's algorithm in C++.
- `PrimExample.cpp`: Example use case of Prim's algorithm for building a cost-effective cable
  network to connect multiple houses.
- `PrimPseudo.txt`: Pseudocode for Prim's algorithm.
